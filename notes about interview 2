What would you do to check if a web page is accessible?
check to see if the code is using semantic html, headers article, section, footer, nav
aria- live attributes in buttons, or inputs,  call to action, 
img, has alt attr to describe 
axe for high contrast and visually accessible
when two dev are working on the same file and need to merge their conflicts in the code sections, and then they have to decide which version or code is used and pushed to master
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

a more Senior developer or software engineer, with more experience at this company, having been promoted.
